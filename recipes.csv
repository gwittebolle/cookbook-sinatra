Boeuf en Croûte,"This boeuf en croûte recipe is an easy, do-ahead, spectacular, and delicious way to serve beef filet. It can easily be expanded to serve however many you need. A nice twist on the standard — without the traditional pâté de foie gras. This is a big hit with both my family and my guests. Choose flavorful mushrooms like criminis, portobellos, or even porcinis or morels. For the wine, choose something rich you would actually drink, such as a good Shiraz or Pinotage. Perfect served with asparagus."
